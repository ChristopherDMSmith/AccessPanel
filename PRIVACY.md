## Local Storage

This data remains on the user’s device and is only accessed during explicit user-initiated actions.

No data is transmitted to any third-party services outside of the intended API requests initiated by the user.

## Third-Party Access

AccessPanel does not sell, share, or disclose user data to third parties.
